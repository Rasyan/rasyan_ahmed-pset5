# Multiple to do lists
This is an app where you can create multiple todo lists and add items to these lists.

the singleton class ListsManager contains a arraylist of TodoLists objects, these themself contain lists TodoItems.
All of these are saved in a SQLite database.

# Tour of the app.


![example1](https://github.com/Rasyan/Rasyan_ahmed-pset5/blob/master/doc/ss1.png)
This is the start screen, at the moment it contians 4 lists

![example1](https://github.com/Rasyan/Rasyan_ahmed-pset5/blob/master/doc/ss2.png)
this is a view of one of the lists, the first item is already done and grayed out, this was done by clicking it once

![example1](https://github.com/Rasyan/Rasyan_ahmed-pset5/blob/master/doc/ss3.png)
here we add another item to the list, this screen was brought up by clicking the plus button on the bottem right

![example1](https://github.com/Rasyan/Rasyan_ahmed-pset5/blob/master/doc/ss4.png)
this is the result, the item was added to the list.

![example1](https://github.com/Rasyan/Rasyan_ahmed-pset5/blob/master/doc/ss5.png)
here we are back in in the previous activity, we long clicked the third list and thats how we got in this screen.

![example1](https://github.com/Rasyan/Rasyan_ahmed-pset5/blob/master/doc/ss6.png)
the result is that that list is deleted, also note that the first list now shows that there are 4 items in it.
